# Chip8 Emulator Project

This is my attempt to create a Chip8 emulator.

The aims of the project are to:

- Reinforce the C++ skills & practices I learn in my professional life.
- Be completely unrelated to my day-to-day work in order to stretch my abilities within a new context.
- Deepen my understanding of computer architecture: CPU emulation, memory management, I/O, etc.
